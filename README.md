# Fix your Mac woes with a single script.
This is a library of Ruby scripts curated specifically to act as ***informative***, ***non-destructive***, ***run-once*** solutions to some common issues plaguing Mac OS X. They have ***no dependencies*** other than a normal installation of Ruby, which comes with Mac OS X by default.

Each script is provided as its own gist, so they can be downloaded/forked/starred/shared individually. More importantly, the gist page provides an ideal location for community discussion regarding specific problems/solutions, as well as additional information and/or resources.

## System
**TODO:** system description/specs here

These scripts are intended for use within Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks

## Fixes
**TODO:** create standardized format for fixes (gist links?)

1. **Install Nokogiri**

    Installs the `nokogiri` gem by configuring for use with modern `libxml2`, `libxslt`, and `libiconv` libs
    
2. **`systemstats` memory leak**

    Disables the `systemstats` daemon which can cause massive memory leakage in Mavericks
    

### TODO:
- add disclaimer
- setup gists
- integrate brew-fixes
